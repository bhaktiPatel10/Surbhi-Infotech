This phrase now has a more positive connotation. In everyday life, almost everyone comes across machine learning. You could, for example, converse with a website chatbot, be presented promotional offers according to your interests, or set up a spam filter in your email service.

Machine learning methods are diverse, but they can be loosely split into two categories: learning with a teacher and learning without a teacher.

The following is the algorithm for marketers' work: Hypotheses are developed, tested, evaluated, and analysed by marketers. Because information changes every second, this effort is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the findings are occasionally wrong.
