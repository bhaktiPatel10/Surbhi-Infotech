                                        Consumers' and businesses' daily lives are heavily influenced by mobile apps. Almost everyone uses their phone during the day, albeit not frequently enough for some of us. The majority of this time is spent using different apps. A company moves to the next level when it can provide a mobile app that encapsulates all of the essential services they provide in a neat, user-friendly package. The question of "Should we obtain a mobile app?" is less relevant in 2017 than "When should we get a mobile app?" Here are five reasons to consider developing a mobile app for your company if it doesn't already have one or if it's subpar.
