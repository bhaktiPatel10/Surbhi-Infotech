                                        A significant portion of most people's investing portfolios has traditionally included real estate. Most of that real estate, if not all of it, has been "real." But the modern real estate investor might also be thinking about something a little less tangible: virtual land. For investors who aren't hesitant to take a bet on cutting-edge technology, building a virtual real estate portfolio may be the next big thing.

Land in the metaverse, a network of virtual worlds where purchasing virtual property is possible, may be just as valuable as real estate and has even caught the interest of well-known figures like Snoop Dogg and corporations like PricewaterhouseCoopers.
